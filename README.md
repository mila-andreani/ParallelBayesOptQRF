# BayesOptQRF
BayesOptQRF is an R function that combines the power of Bayesian optimization with the flexibility of Quantile Regression Forests. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for optimizing complex, non-linear functions while accommodating uncertainty and capturing heterogeneity in data. In particular, it is built upon the R packages ....

## Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is a powerful optimization technique that is particularly useful for optimizing black-box functions where the objective function is expensive to evaluate and may be noisy or uncertain. It works by building a probabilistic model of the objective function and using this model to guide the search for the optimal solution. By iteratively selecting the next point to evaluate based on a balance of exploration and exploitation, Bayesian optimization can efficiently find the global optimum with a minimal number of evaluations.

## Quantile Regression Forests

Quantile regression forests are a flexible and robust method for estimating conditional quantiles of a response variable. They extend traditional regression forests by allowing the estimation of multiple quantiles simultaneously, making them well-suited for capturing heterogeneity in the data and providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between predictors and the response variable.

## Functionality

BayesOptQRF provides a user-friendly interface for performing Bayesian optimization with quantile regression forests in R. Users can specify their objective function, define the search space, and set optimization parameters such as the number of iterations and the acquisition function to use. The package then uses a combination of Bayesian optimization and quantile regression forests to efficiently search for the optimal solution while accounting for uncertainty and heterogeneity in the data.
